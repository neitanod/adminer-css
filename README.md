The adminer theme I like to use.

Based on a theme by Pepa Linha [http://webdream.cz]

Adminer itself can also be installed via a single command:

```
wget -O index.php https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/download/v4.8.1/adminer-4.8.1-en.php
```

or

```
curl https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/download/v4.8.1/adminer-4.8.1-en.php > index.php
```
